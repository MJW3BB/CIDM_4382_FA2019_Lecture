// CIDM-4382 Notes
    - November 4, 2019

- Need to decide on project idea by Nov. 11

- The topic of the class has now switched to Angular

Front end frameworks to get you a job
    - Angular
    - React
    - Vue

Front-End-Framework --> Uses JavaScript --> Virtual DOM --> Binds data
    - Start Chapter 8 on the Book**

MongoDB --> Web Server (Express) (HTTP Request) --> Display results in browser (Front-end)
    - Goal is to offer HTTP endpoints for front end use on a website

Think about and articulate project

    - Angular Tasks
        1.) - Tour of Heroes - https://angular.io/tutorial
        2.) - Chapter 8 in the book

    - Project component requirements
        - MongoDB Database
        - Web Server (REST Endpoints)
        - Cloud API (Someone elses API, maybe Extreme?)
            - Ex; VATSIM, Weather, etc...

Angular 
    - Uses components and how do I use them?
    - Modularity and the ability to create modules
    - Creates a Virtual DOM --> Client side JS/TS framework [VDOM and data binding]
        Anytime data changes on the front or back-end the other is notified of said changes and writes them
    - 

MongoDB (schema) + generic API --> Web Server --> Internet --> Front-End 
    - 1.) Create a schema
    - 2.) Use a API to push data up to a web Server
    - 3.) Take the data placed on the web server and show it on a front-end web interface
    - 4.) Format the data to be visually appealing

    DO NOT USE ANGULAR JS!! IT WILL BE EUTHANIZED 

Gettins started w/ Angular 
    - ng lists all available commands for Angular 
    - npm install -g @angular/cli
    - ng new <ProjectName>
    - y
    - Choose "CSS"
    - ng serve 
    - go to http://localhost:4200/

    - ng generate component <componentName> - adds components to src/app/


No class on wednesday, project review on monday. Start on project
