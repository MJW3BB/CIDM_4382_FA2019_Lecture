Goto https://words.bighugelabs.com/ and download/ create key

Objective is to use Simon and Clives code and be introduced to Mongo, 
    which extracts data from a DB and places into application

- Eventually we will have a project assigned to us by Dr. Babb.
- We will also create our own project later on as well

download babs "nickname code" from his repo https://github.com/ahuimanu/CIDM4382-Fall2019.git

Install needed dependencies (use sudo if on mac)

    npm install

    express -- pug - git
    npm install axios --save

The point of the big huge API is to go out to the internet to retrieve information.

.json - JavaScript Object Notation

The purpose of an API call is to return information requsted.

Remember you DataBase training Luke!
------------------------------------

varchar(50) - sets a character string with a maximum value of 50 characters
integer(5) - sets a int string with max value of 5

The purpose of and API is undertancd where the endpoint ends, specifics of the request.
BABB SAID THIS CONCEPT IS FUNDEMTAL TO UNDERSTANDING THE COURSE

OKay, now how do i use all this?
--------------------------------

look at controller\main.js in Babbs code [lines 24 - 28], Its all about request and reposne 

        // https://words.bighugelabs.com/site/api
            axios.all([
                axios.get("https://words.bighugelabs.com/api/2/" + BHL_KEY + "/" + req.body.ptraits + "/json"), <------ Request
                axios.get("https://words.bighugelabs.com/api/2/" + BHL_KEY + "/" + req.body.ntraits + "/json")  <------ Request
            ]).then((responses) => { <--------- responses (bundled)

One of things we need to get used to is the Asynchronous nature of the internet (latency)

latecy is the delay between request and response, gonna have to get used to promises. 

A promise is a request to return information once all prerequisites have been met.
            (Ex; Find out what everyone in the office wants for lunch and get back to me)
            (Ex; Find out the IP addresses of those switches and get back to me)

THe crux is the function NICKNAME goes and gets the nickname in app_server\views with a form 

We are not ready to read from databases yet, so we will create a hard coded db within the application.

Babbs code uses es6

const and let 
    const is constant is something that is predicted to never change
    let is something subject to change

In pug template if you want some arbitrary javascript place a negative 

    block content

        - let words = ["one", "two", "three"];
        // below is a block-level unbuffered code block - https://github.com/pugjs/pug/issues/502#issuecomment-137893041
        -
            let negative_traits = [
            "aloof","apathetic","callous","cheerless","closed","cold","combative","conceited",
            "constricting","controlling","cowering","dependent","dishonest","distant","fearful",
            "fleeting","gloomy","grumpy","guarded","hostile","immature","impolite","impractical",
            "inconsiderate","indecisive","indecisive","indifferent","indulgent","insecure",
            "insincere","intolerant","jealous","lazy","mean","mistrusting","naÃ¯ve","ostentatious",
            "pessimistic","petty","resentful","rigid","rude","scattered","secretive","selfish",
            "self-satisfied","sour","stubborn","tardy","thoughtless","uncaring","uncommitted",
            "uncooperative","unenthusiastic","unfeeling","ungrateful","unhelpful","unmotivated",
            "unreceptive","unreliable","unsympathetic","vain","wasteful",
            ];

A book walks you through concepts, a video or web page walks you through solutions


Dont waste time style a web page, focus on functionality and usuability first, then style.


Now we need to run Its

Place your API Key into a .env file

IN your project create a .env file (stands for enviroment variable).
Inside the file create this lines

    BHL_KEY=<YOUR API KEY>

Be sure to use 2 adjectives and avoid synonyms when using the big thesaurus API


Class Questions
-------------------------

Dont use any positive negative traits, use a differnt theory (optional)
Dont use Adjective + Synonym combination (Ex; use approximate or descriptive adjective.) not an adjective 
dont use positive, negative traits boxes, or Babbs list
