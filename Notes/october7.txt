Making MongoDB Schema and Project details

Scheme - Specifies what goes into the application
Class - Specifies what goes up to MongoDB

Utilize the request/response of an API (Appliation Programming Interface)
Representational State Transfer (RST)

URL Paths and API Specification



Exposing and Consuming an API
-------------------------------
With MongoDB in place, we want to:
    Implement CRUD functionality with HTTP verbs
        GET
        POST
        PUT
        DELETE
        Because ports 80 and 443 are likely to be open in your organization
Use Node, Express, and Mongoose to implement a persistence strategy

REST API
------------
Representational State Transfer
Applications Programming Interface (API)

Response Strategy
---------------------
Two Key Components
    Returned Data
        JSON with Data
        JSON with error data
            Including HTTP Response Code
        Null


RTFM - https://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html

Lets get started

http://status.vatsim.net/ 

We are going to create something similar to https://www.vattastic.com/

cron = sets data to refresh at a set interval

Learn to use cron - https://crontab.guru/

Take a look at the VATSIM Harvester in Babbs Code  

        this.callsign = callsign;
        this.cid = cid;
        this.realname = realname;
        this.clienttype = clienttype;
        this.frequency = frequency;
        this.latitude = latitude;
        this.longitude = longitude;
        this.altitude = altitude;
        this.groundspeed = groundspeed;
        this.planned_tascruise = planned_tascruise;
        this.planned_depairport = planned_depairport;
        this.planned_altitude = planned_altitude;
        this.planned_destairport = planned_destairport;
        this.server = server;
        this.protrevision = protrevision;
        this.rating = rating;
        this.transponder = transponder;
        this.facilitytype = facilitytype;
        this.visualrange = visualrange;
        this.planned_revision = planned_revision;
        this.planned_flighttype = planned_flighttype;
        this.planned_deptime = planned_deptime;
        this.planned_actdeptime = planned_actdeptime;
        this.planned_hrsenroute = planned_hrsenroute;
        this.planned_minenroute = planned_minenroute;
        this.planned_hrsfuel = planned_hrsfuel;
        this.planned_minfuel = planned_minfuel;
        this.planned_altairport = planned_altairport;
        this.planned_remarks = planned_remarks;
        this.planned_route = planned_route;
        this.planned_depairport_lat = planned_depairport_lat;
        this.planned_depairport_lon = planned_depairport_lon;
        this.planned_destairport_lat = planned_destairport_lat;
        this.planned_destairport_lon = planned_depairport_lon;
        this.atis_message = atis_message;
        this.time_last_atis_received = time_last_atis_received;
        this.time_logon = time_logon;
        this.heading = heading;
        this.QNH_iHg = QNH_iHg;
        this.QNH_Mb = QNH_Mb;
    }

Be prepared for wednesday make a schema and then babb will assign Project
