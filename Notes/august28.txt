- 3 Questions
    + What gets shipped to the web browser?
    + What lives in the client?
    + What gets shipped to the client?

- The main point is to send HTML, CSS, and JS to the browser

++ Getting MEAN Chapter 01 ++
- Tools
    + MongoDB - Database (stores JSON like data)
    + Express - Backend web framework
    + Angular - Front-end web framework
    + Node.js - web server and server side execution environment
    + Why? (YOU DONT KNOW ENOUGH JAVASCRIPT)

- Create a virtual document object model (VDOM) in front of the real one (DOM) in order to control things more precisley.

- Front-end Vs. Back-end (and Full Stack)
    + There is a divergence from back-end and front-end
        * Back-end
            > Logistics and Functionality based
        * Front-end
            > UX and UI Design, Aesthetic, etc...
        * Full-Stack
            > Does both

- Database - MongoDB
- Application Server 
    + Node.js and Express
        * Language: JavaScript 
- Front end - Angular 
    + Language: TypeScript

- Multi-threaded is worse than single threaded as dupicate entires can be made (Chaos)

- Mongoose
    + MongoDB --> Mongoose --> Applications
                * Connections
                * Schemas
                * Queries
                * Validations
                * Aggregations
                * etc...
- Angular
    + Single-Page-Architecture
    + Batteries included and opionated framework
        * jQuery by comparison is a library
    + DOM manipulation
    + Two-way data binding
    + TypeScript
    + Webpage changes will indicate changes on the server

- Use CodePen and w3 schools to create a name generator with basic javascript
